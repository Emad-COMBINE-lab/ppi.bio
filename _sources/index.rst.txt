Welcome, to the documentation for self-hosting a PPI.bio server. This is the code that runs
`PPI.bio <https://ppi.bio>`_.

What is this?
-------------
PPI.bio is a web interface for RAPPPID and INTREPPPID, a deep-learning models for predicting
`protein-protein interactions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93protein_interaction>`_ (PPIs). This online
interface allows you to use RAPPPID and INTREPPPID through your browser. This is the documentation about how you can run it on your own
server. You can try out the live version on `PPI.bio <https://ppi.bio>`_ You can learn more on the `about <about.html>`_ page.

New here?
---------
Check-out the `getting started <getting_started.html>`_ page.

Are you using INTREPPID/RAPPPID?
