<p>
  This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.
</p>
<p>
  For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br>
  For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
</p>

<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>

  <p>This Application only uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called “first-party” Trackers).<br>
The validity and expiration periods of first-party Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner. Some of them expire upon termination of the User’s browsing session.

<h3 class="iub-subheading iub-subheading-manage-gdpr" id="manage_cookies">How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent</h3>
<p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>
<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>
<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User’s initial consent.</p>
<p>Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>


<h4>Locating Tracker Settings</h4>
<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>

</ul>
<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p>



<h4>Consequences of denying consent</h4>
<p>Users are free to decide whether or not to grant consent. However, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, in the absence of the User's consent, the Owner may be unable to provide related features.</p>
