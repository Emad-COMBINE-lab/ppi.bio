title: Threshold Guidelines for the INTREPPPID Model
---

Knowing how to interpret the scores generated by PPI inference models can sometimes be challenging. What follows
is some guidance how to use interpret protein interaction scores computed by the INTREPPPID model.

When benchmarked on strict _H. sapiens_ protein-interaction datasets, INTREPPPID scores an average 
[Brier Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) of 0.200 (±0.004). This indicates that, while not perfect, 
INTREPPPID is fairly well calibrated.

Knowing at what threshold to label two proteins as "interacting" given its INTREPPPID score can be challenging, and
primarily depends on your needs and the analysis you are conducting. The 
[Youden J's statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youden's_J_statistic) can be a useful method for determining the 
optimal cut-off point. We measured an average J statistic of 0.479 (±0.080).

Sometimes, [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) is more important than 
[recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall). In these cases, taking the top _e.g._ 95th percentile can
be a useful technique.
